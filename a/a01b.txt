# This text file contains historical data for every team/score/base/out/inning
# situation in the majors from 1979 to 1990.  It was derived from Retrosheet
# data (www.retrosheet.org).
# 
# The first field is the team (home, visitor).  The next is the inning.
# The next is the number of outs.  Then comes the base situation (see below).
# The last two are the score -- batting team minus pitching team.
# 
# The second last field is the number of times this situation occurred; the
# last field is the number of those games the batting team eventually won.
# 
# For instance,
# 
# "H",1,0,5,2,54,49
# 
# means that the home team is batting in the first inning, with no outs and
# a runner on third, up by two runs.  There were 54 of those games, and the
# batting team eventually won 49 of them.
# 
# Base/out situations:
#   
# 1 = nobody on
# 2 = runner on 1st
# 3 = runner on 2nd
# 4 = runners on 1st and 2nd
# 5 = runner on 3rd
# 6 = runners on 1st and 3rd
# 7 = runners on 2nd and 3rd
# 8 = bases loaded
